> There are several ways to get started with react.
## create-react-app

**Create React App** is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new [single-page application](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application) in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have **Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6** on your machine. To create a project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
